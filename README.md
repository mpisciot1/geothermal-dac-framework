## Description of Included Files
Each of the following are Aspen Plus files (.apwz) that were generated using Aspen Plus v.14.1
- ResT86_DACParallel.apwz: Model for the 86ºC geothermal reservoir configured with DAC in Parallel with the ORC
- ResT86_DACUpstream.apwz: Model for the 86ºC geothermal reservoir configured with DAC Upstream of the ORC
- ResT225_DACDownstream.apwz: Model for the 225ºC geothermal reservoir configured with DAC Downstream of the ORC
- ResT225_DACParallel.apwz: Model for the 225ºC geothermal reservoir configured with DAC in Parallel with the ORC
- RiverRaft_DACDownstream_HPORC.apwz: Model for the River Raft geothermal power plant configured with DAC Downstream of the high pressure ORC
- RiverRaft_DACParallel_Full.apwz: Model for the River Raft geothermal combined cycle power plant configured with DAC in Parallel with the high pressure ORC and the low pressure ORC downstream of both
- RiverRaft_DACUpstream_LPORC.apwz: Model for the River Raft geothermal power plant configured with DAC Upstream of the low pressure ORC
